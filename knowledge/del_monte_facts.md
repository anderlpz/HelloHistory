## Design Characteristics

### "Skin and Bones" Architecture

Del Monte exemplifies the "skin and bones" architecture that was emblematic of International-Style modernism. Pacific Northwest modernists like Davis appropriated this style with local timber materials to great effect.

**Structure:**
- Light wooden frame
- Thin, elegant skin
- 3/4" plywood
- Single-pane glass
- Cement board
- Secured by selfsame sills that hold the skin to a single plane

**Interior Materials:**
- Fir decking
- Drapery
- Cork interior walls
- Asphalt tile flooring
- Plywood panels
- Masonite
- Laminate cabinetry (Monitor Cabinets)

### Tree House Quality

The structural system was designed to accept the sheet goods that Tacoma Mill Work Supply produced. The result is an exceedingly light "tree house" perched among the evergreens.

**Overhead Structure:**
- 4x12" beams project the fir ceiling beyond clerestory windows
- Creates a feeling of lightness
- Structure appears suspended amongst evergreen boughs
- Interior plywood panels float within rhythmic structure
- Appears to grow out of hillside amongst tree trunks

## Spatial Design

### Compact Living

Davis's compact design achieves comfortable living within a small space. The program was built precisely to the young couple's needs.

**Kitchen:**
- Small kitchen with ample storage
- Opens via 4' sliding door onto east-facing deck
- Gathers morning light
- Connects to open living room across built-in dining table
- Makes both spaces feel larger

**Living Areas:**
- Open floor plan
- Built-in dining table connecting kitchen to living room
- Spaces feel larger through connection

**Bedroom:**
- Gathers evening light through west-facing clerestory windows
- Allows connection to surrounding canopy
- Maintains street-front privacy

### Cabinetry as Space Dividers

Davis used Monitor cabinets to divide the rectangular footprint into distinct but connected spaces.

- Extensive cabinets in kitchen create ample storage
- Bookcase/closet wall divides living room and bedroom
- Clerestory windows bridge the two spaces
- Additional closet space in bedroom separates sleeping area from bathroom
- Walk-in closet creates increasing levels of privacy within open design

## Building Skin & Transparency

The skin mediates levels of transparency throughout the open floor plan:

- Plywood (opaque)
- Single-pane glass (transparent)
- Cement board
- Woven drapery (variable)

Together these materials create a mosaic that controls light, views, and privacy.

## Connection to Nature

### Indoor/Outdoor Living

Like all of Davis's designs, Del Monte emphasizes connection between interior and exterior:

- East-facing deck for morning light
- West-facing clerestory for evening light
- Structure appears to grow from the hillside
- Feeling of being suspended in the tree canopy

### Natural Light

Multiple strategies bring natural light into the home:

- Clerestory windows (high windows below roofline)
- Large sliding doors
- Strategic window placement for morning/evening light
- Overhangs that allow winter sun while blocking summer heat
