## The Story Behind Del Monte

### Why They Built It

In 1954, Mary (age 32) and George Davis were young newlyweds who had been married for 4 years. They had founded Monitor Cabinets in 1948 and Mary had started her own architecture practice in 1952. They needed both a home and an office.

### The Resourceful Approach

The Davis's were "not wealthy but were resourceful." They used their knowledge of cabinets and sheet goods to create an affordable design:

- **The lot:** Purchased for $650 - the steep hillside made it inexpensive, but Mary turned this "liability" into a design feature
- **The construction:** Mary and George worked alongside their workers as "errand boys, laborers, apprentice carpenters, and painters" to speed up construction and reduce labor costs
- **The materials:** The house was designed to use the sheet goods they manufactured at Tacoma Mill Work Supply - many materials came at cost or free
- **The cabinets:** Monitor Cabinets were used throughout - and they were free since Mary and George owned the company

### The Name

The house was named "Del Monte" after Del Monte Street in Fircrest where it was located. The archive officially labels it "The Davis Residence, 1954," but the family always called it "Del Monte."

## Architectural Details

### Structure: Post and Beam

Del Monte is **post and beam construction** sitting upon a fir deck bolted to an expressive retaining wall.

**Primary Structure:**
- 2x4" and 4x4" posts spaced 4.25' apart (to accept standard 4'x8' sheet goods)
- 26' long 4x12" beams overhead
- 2x6" v-joint fir decking on top
- Posts positioned to accept pre-cut Masonite boards and 3/4" plywood sheets

**The Logic:**
The entire structural system was dictated by the dimensions of standardized, pre-manufactured sheet goods. This wasn't just practical - it created a clear visual rhythm.

### The "Skin and Bones" Philosophy

Del Monte exemplifies what's called "skin and bones" architecture - emblematic of International-Style modernism that Pacific Northwest architects like Mary adapted with local timber materials.

**The Skin (Exterior/Interior Cladding):**
- 3/4" plywood sheets
- Pre-cut Masonite boards
- Single-pane glass
- All secured by identical sills that hold the skin to a single plane

**The Bones (Structure):**
- Light wooden frame
- Post and beam construction
- Exposed overhead beams and decking

### The "Tree House" Effect

The thesis describes Del Monte as an "exceedingly light 'skin and bones' tree house."

**What creates this feeling:**
- 4x12" beams project beyond the walls into the surrounding trees
- Fir ceiling extends past clerestory windows
- Structure appears suspended among evergreen boughs
- Interior plywood panels float within the rhythmic structure
- The house seems to grow out of the hillside among tree trunks
- The v-joint fir decking overhead "inspires a feeling of lightness like a tree house or a tent in a Sacramento rice field" (a reference to Mary's birthplace)

### The Hillside Advantage

The sharp pitch of the land (which made the lot cheap at $650) became a design opportunity:
- The house is elevated above the slope
- Covered parking is provided underneath
- Existing trees and shrubbery were left intact (eliminating landscaping costs and maintenance)
- The house appears to float among the trees

## Interior Design

### The Five Spaces

The living level footprint is divided into five distinct spaces:
1. **Kitchen**
2. **Living Room**
3. **Bathroom**
4. **Bedroom**
5. **Closet**

### Cabinetry Instead of Walls

Mary used cabinets in place of walls to shape interior space for two reasons:
1. **Practical:** Added storage to a small space
2. **Economic:** The Monitor Cabinets were free

**How cabinets define space:**
- Kitchen cabinets create extensive storage
- A bookcase/closet wall divides living room from bedroom
- Additional closet space separates sleeping area from bathroom
- Creates increasing levels of privacy within the open design

### Built-In Furniture

The furniture was also Monitor:
- **Kitchen counter extends and drops to form the dining table**
- Another sheet of Masonite board floats the living room couch
- Built-in elements throughout

### The Plumbing Strategy

Davis concentrated "serving" fixtures to reduce costs with a **shared plumbing tree** - the bathroom and kitchen share one plumbing stack.

## Light and Views

### The Clerestory Windows

Clerestory windows (high windows just below the roofline) run all the way around the house:
- **East-facing:** Gather morning light for the kitchen
- **West-facing:** Bring evening light to the bedroom while maintaining street-front privacy
- **Effect:** Creates connection to the surrounding tree canopy

### The Glazing Strategy

Large glazing areas throughout create:
- A feeling of adequate enclosure in private areas
- Openness in public areas
- Connection to the outdoors

### The Mosaic Skin

The exterior/interior skin creates a "mosaic" of transparency:
- **Plywood:** Opaque - for privacy
- **Glass:** Transparent - for views and light
- **Masonite:** Semi-opaque
- **Drapery:** Variable transparency

This mosaic controls light, views, and privacy throughout the day.

---

## The Deck

An **expansive deck** furthers the experience of openness and connection to the surrounding environment:
- Opens via 4' sliding door from the kitchen
- East-facing orientation gathers morning light
- Extends the living space outdoors
- Connects to the surrounding landscape

---

## Materials Palette

### Exterior
- 3/4" plywood
- Pre-cut Masonite boards
- Single-pane glass
- All secured by selfsame sills

### Interior
- Fir decking (ceiling)
- Cork interior walls
- Asphalt tile flooring
- Plywood panels
- Masonite
- Laminate cabinetry (Monitor Cabinets)
- Woven drapery

## Recognition

### 1966 A.I.A.-Sunset Western Home Award

Though the home was built in 1954, it received the **A.I.A.-Sunset Western Home Award in 1966** - 12 years after construction. This award recognized:
- The innovative use of dimensional structure
- Creative application of pre-manufactured sheet goods
- The successful marriage of affordability and design quality

### Architectural Significance

The notoriety of Del Monte "marked Mary Lund Davis' professional venture into post-war affordable architecture." It established patterns she would refine throughout her career in the Fantastic Homes and other projects.

### Photography

The house was photographed by **Dearborn Massar**, an architectural photographer whose images are held in the University of Washington Libraries collection. These photographs document:
- Del Monte from the street
- The staircase and materiality
- Interior views (living room, kitchen, bedroom)
- The house in winter
- Views from the surrounding woods

## After Mary: The House's Later Life

### The Renter: "Redman"
After Mary and George moved to their second home (Alameda), Del Monte was rented:
- **David Reese Johnson** (known as "Redman") rented Del Monte
- He was a jazz piano teacher
- He had an upright Yamaha piano where Mary's drafting table once was
- Nevis (Mary's grandson) took jazz piano lessons there as a child
- Redman's "frenetic but kind" lifestyle "tested the durability of Mary's laminate cabinets" - they held up fine

### Mary's Wish
"Mary asked that Del Monte never be sold. She considered it her finest building."

### The Sale
The family sold Del Monte in 2011. Nevis writes in his thesis: "But the family sold it in 2011 before I was concerned with keeping family history together nor knew how difficult it is to get back once its gone."

2. **Pure expression:** Built for herself, she had complete creative control
3. **Resourcefulness:** It proved her philosophy that quality design doesn't require large budgets
4. **Innovation:** It established the "skin and bones" approach she'd use throughout her career
5. **Personal meaning:** Built at the beginning of her marriage and career, it represented possibility
6. **Integration:** The perfect fusion of her cabinetry and architecture expertise

## Design Principles Embodied in Del Monte

1. **"All low-cost housing doesn't have to be cheap"** - Quality design on a $6,350 budget

4. **Honest materials** - Plywood, fir, glass - all visible, not hidden
5. **Light as design element** - Morning light east, evening light west
6. **Structure as expression** - The bones are visible and beautiful
7. **Economy of means** - Every element serves multiple purposes
8. **Connection to nature** - Tree house feeling, growing from hillside
