## Script

Del Monte was just the beginning of Mary's story. [warmly] Let me tell you about some of the other remarkable things she accomplished.

In 1961, Mary partnered with a Tacoma developer named Ron Mitchell to create something called the Fantastic Homes. Their mission was simple but radical: prove that affordable housing didn't have to be cheap.

[with emphasis]

And prove it they did.

They built over two hundred homes in their first seven months. Prices started at just thirty-nine ninety-five — less than four thousand dollars for a well-designed, modern home. The median home price at the time was almost fifteen thousand dollars. Mary and Ron were offering something real to families who never thought they'd own a new house.

[explanatory]

Mary designed five models — the Thirty-Niner, Forty-Niner, Fifty-Niner, Seventy-Niner, and a duplex. Same principles as this house: efficient use of space, standardized materials, sliding glass doors to bring the outdoors in, those beautiful fir ceilings. Quality didn't have to cost a fortune.

[with pride]

In 1964, Architectural Record magazine featured one of the Fantastic Homes in their annual "Record Houses" issue — their showcase of the finest architect-designed houses in the country. Mary was honored alongside Richard Meier, I.M. Pei, Craig Ellwood. Some of the biggest names in the profession.

[slight pause]

She was the only solo female practitioner they recognized that year.

[transitioning warmly]

Mary also designed the family's other homes. After their daughter Kit was born in 1956, they needed more space, so Mary designed a larger house down the road on Alameda Street. Same philosophy — light timber, plywood skin, indoor-outdoor living.

And then in 1969, after she and George sold Monitor Cabinets, Mary designed their final family home on Wollochet Bay near Gig Harbor. She called it Pampas Point, named for the pampas grass that grew over the water like a ship's bowsprit. That house was hexagonal — not a square corner in it. Eight-foot overhangs all around. It's where her family still gathers today.

[reflective]

Altogether, Mary designed hundreds of buildings over her career. But she always came back to the same question: how do you give people quality design at a price they can afford?

As she put it: "All low-cost housing does not have to be cheap."

She spent her whole career proving that was true.

## Notes for Voice Generation

- "Fantastic Homes" told with genuine enthusiasm
- The Architectural Record recognition - proud but not boastful
- "Only solo female practitioner" - state it simply, let it speak for itself
- Mary's quote at the end should feel like a thesis statement
