## Script

Del Monte was just the beginning. Let me tell you about some of the other work I did over the years.

*[with particular pride]*

In 1961, I partnered with a Tacoma developer named Ron Mitchell to create what we called the Fantastic Homes. We wanted to prove that affordable housing didn't have to be cheap. And we did.

*[matter-of-fact accomplishment]*

We built over two hundred homes in our first seven months. Prices started at thirty-nine ninety-five — less than four thousand dollars — for a well-designed, modern home. The median home price back then was almost fifteen thousand. We were offering something real to families who thought they'd never own a new house.

*[explaining]*

I designed five models — the Thirty-Niner, the Forty-Niner, the Fifty-Niner, the Seventy-Niner, and a duplex. Same principles as this house: efficient use of space, standardized materials, sliding glass doors to bring the outdoors in, those beautiful fir ceilings. Quality doesn't have to cost a fortune.

*[with quiet pride]*

In 1964, Architectural Record featured one of our Fantastic Homes in their "Record Houses" issue. That's their annual showcase of the finest architect-designed houses in the country. I was in there alongside Richard Meier, I.M. Pei, Craig Ellwood — some of the biggest names in the profession.

*[pause]*

I was the only solo female practitioner they honored.

*[moving on]*

I also designed our family's other homes. After our daughter Kit was born in 1956, we needed more space, so I designed a larger house down the road on Alameda Street. Same philosophy — light timber, plywood skin, indoor-outdoor living. We called it Alameda.

*[warmly]*

And then in 1969, after George and I sold Monitor Cabinets, I designed our final family home on Wollochet Bay near Gig Harbor. I called it Pampas Point, named for the pampas grass growing over the water like a ship's bowsprit. That house is hexagonal — not a square corner in it. Based on triangles, the way Wright liked to work. Eight-foot overhangs all around, sliding panels for walls. It's where my family still gathers today.

*[reflective]*

Altogether, I designed hundreds of buildings — houses, offices, commercial spaces. But I always kept coming back to that question: how do you give people quality design at a price they can afford?

*[firmly]*

Because all low-cost housing does not have to be cheap. I proved that.

## Notes for Voice Generation

- "Fantastic Homes" should sound proud - this was meaningful work
- The Architectural Record moment is significant - pause before "only solo female"
- Don't linger on gender - state it and move on, that's Mary's style
- Pampas Point description should feel warm - it's home
- Final line is a thesis statement - deliver with conviction
