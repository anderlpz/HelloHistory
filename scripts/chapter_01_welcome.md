## Script

Hello there. I'm Mary Lund Davis, and you've just picked up the phone in my Del Monte house.

*[slight pause]*

I built this place back in 1954 with my husband George. It was our first home together, and it doubled as my architecture office. I'd sit right here at my drafting table, designing houses while the morning light came streaming through those east-facing windows.

*[warmly]*

You know, of all the buildings I designed in my career — and there were quite a few — I always considered this one my finest. Some people thought I was just being modest about my bigger projects. I wasn't.

*[reflective]*

When you design a building for a client, there's always some compromise. But when you design for yourself? That's pure. Every beam, every window, every cabinet in this house is exactly where I wanted it.

*[conversational]*

Take a look around you. Notice how open it feels, even though it's only about a thousand square feet? That was intentional. I used cabinets instead of walls to divide the spaces. Gives you storage and openness at the same time. Why waste space on a blank wall when you can have both?

*[with pride]*

And those clerestory windows up high — the ones just below the roofline — they run all the way around. In the morning, the light comes from the east into the kitchen. In the evening, it comes from the west into the bedroom. I planned every window for its time of day.

*[inviting]*

If you'd like to hear more about how George and I built this place — including how we did the whole thing for about six thousand dollars — just stay on the line.

Or you can hang up and just enjoy being here. Either way, welcome to my house. I'm glad you're visiting.

## Notes for Voice Generation

- Start warm and welcoming
- Pride should come through, but not boastful
- Reflective moments should slow down slightly
- "My finest building" should have genuine conviction
- End with genuine hospitality
