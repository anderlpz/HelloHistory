[Chapter 1: Welcome to Del Monte]

You're staying in a piece of mid-century architectural history.

In 1954, a young architect named Mary Lund Davis built this house with her husband George. It was her first home, her office, and what she always called <break time="0.5s" /> her finest building.

Now, Mary wasn't just any architect. She was the first woman to become a licensed architect in Washington State after World War Two. <break time="0.5s" /> And this modest house on a hillside in Fircrest? She and George built the whole thing themselves.

Take a look around you. <break time="1s" /> Notice how open it feels, even though it's only about a thousand square feet? That was intentional. Mary used cabinets instead of walls to divide the spaces — a signature of her work. Why waste space on a blank wall when you can have storage and openness at the same time?

And those windows up high, just below the roofline — those are called clerestory windows. They run all the way around the house. Mary planned every single one for a specific time of day. <break time="0.5s" /> Morning light comes from the east, into the kitchen. Evening light comes from the west, into the bedroom. <break time="1s" />

Mary always sought to think about every square inch of her properties deeply and intentionally. That's what makes them so special.

Over the next few minutes, I would like to tell you more — about Mary's remarkable life, how she came to build this place, and why it mattered so much to her.

Stay on the line, and let's explore Del Monte together.
