Welcome to Del Monte. You've just picked up a piece of history.

In 1954, a young architect named Mary Lund Davis built this house with her husband George. It was her first home, her office, and what she always called her finest building.

Now, Mary wasn't just any architect. She was the first woman to become a licensed architect in Washington State after World War Two. And this modest house on a hillside in Fircrest? She and George built the whole thing — lot, house, and all the furniture — for just sixty-three hundred dollars.

Take a look around you. Notice how open it feels, even though it's only about a thousand square feet? That was intentional. Mary used cabinets instead of walls to divide the spaces — a signature of her work. Why waste space on a blank wall, she figured, when you can have storage and openness at the same time?

And those windows up high, just below the roofline — those are called clerestory windows. They run all the way around the house. Mary planned every single one for a specific time of day. Morning light comes from the east, into the kitchen. Evening light comes from the west, into the bedroom.

Mary truly thought of everything.

Over the next few minutes, I would like to tell you more — about Mary's remarkable life, how she and George built this place in just eight weeks, and why she considered it her finest work.

Stay on the line, and let's explore Del Monte together.
