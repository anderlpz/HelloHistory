[Chapter 4: The Design Philosophy]

What makes this house so special? <break time="0.5s" /> Let me try to explain how Mary thought about architecture.

Look up at the ceiling. <break time="1s" /> See those long beams running overhead — and how they extend past the walls, right out into the trees? That's not an accident. Mary wanted this house to feel like it grew from the hillside. Like a tree house. Like you're suspended among the evergreens, not just sitting on the ground.

<break time="1s" />

She loved to quote Frank Lloyd Wright: <break time="0.5s" /> "The human spirit is best when not boxed in." <break time="0.5s" /> And you can feel that philosophy everywhere in this house.

This style came out of the modern movement — a light wooden frame, a thin elegant exterior. But here in the Pacific Northwest, architects like Mary made it their own. They used local timber — Douglas fir, cedar, plywood. Honest materials that don't pretend to be something they're not.

Look at the walls around you. <break time="0.5s" /> You can see exactly what they're made of — plywood panels held in place by simple sills. The same sills hold the glass. Nothing's hidden. The structure is visible, and it's beautiful.

And the way Mary brought the outdoors in — that was everything to her. Those clerestory windows pull light from every direction. The deck extends your living space into the forest. When you open that sliding door on a summer morning, she wanted you to wonder: where does the house end and the world begin?

<break time="1s" />

Mary's philosophy came down to this: use what you have, waste nothing, hide nothing, and always <break time="0.3s" /> — always — <break time="0.2s" /> let the light in.
