What makes this house so special? Let me try to explain how Mary thought about architecture.

Look up at the ceiling. See those long beams running overhead — and how they extend past the walls, right out into the trees? That's not an accident. Mary wanted this house to feel like it grew from the hillside. Like a tree house. Like you're suspended among the evergreens, not just sitting on the ground.

She loved to quote Frank Lloyd Wright: "The human spirit is best when not boxed in." And you can feel that philosophy everywhere in this house.

This style — what architects call "skin and bones" — came out of the International modern movement. A light wooden frame, a thin elegant skin. But here in the Pacific Northwest, architects like Mary adapted it. They used local timber — Douglas fir, cedar, plywood. Honest materials that don't pretend to be something they're not.

Look at the walls around you. You can see exactly what they're made of — plywood panels held in place by simple sills. The same sills hold the glass. It's all one system, one plane. Nothing's hidden. The bones are visible, and they're beautiful.

And the way Mary brought the outdoors in — that was everything to her. Those clerestory windows pull light from every direction. The deck extends your living space into the forest. When you open that sliding door on a summer morning, where does the house end and the world begin?

That's the question she wanted you to ask.

Now, some architects get so caught up in aesthetics that they forget people have to actually live in these spaces. But Mary never forgot. Every cabinet is placed to define a room and give you storage. The plumbing is all on one wall to save money. Form follows function — but in her hands, function was beautiful.

Mary's philosophy came down to this: use what you have, waste nothing, hide nothing, and always — always — let the light in.
