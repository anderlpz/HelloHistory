[Chapter 6: Closing]

Well, I've kept you on the line for a while now. <break time="0.5s" /> Thank you for listening.

<break time="1s" />

Before you hang up, take a moment. Look around — really look. <break time="1s" /> Notice how the light falls. Notice where your eye travels.

Step out onto that deck, and feel how the inside and outside become one thing.

This house has stood for more than seventy years. Morning light has poured through those east windows, evening light has settled into the

bedroom — just as Mary planned. Look up at those beams stretching out toward the trees. They've held this roof through every season since

1954. <break time="0.5s" /> The place still works. It still feels right. And that's what good design does. It persists.

Thank you for visiting Del Monte. Open the windows. Let the air in. Watch the light change through the day.

<break time="1s" />

And if you pick up this phone again, I'll be happy to tell you the story from the beginning. <break time="0.5s" /> Goodbye for now.
