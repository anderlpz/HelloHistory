Now, I've told you about the buildings. [warmly] Let me share a few stories about the life Mary lived.

Mary met George Davis at the University of Washington. They were classmates in the architecture program, and they both won the student AIA gold medal the year they graduated. [light chuckle] She made him wait seven years before she'd marry him.

They got married in 1950, at the home Mary and her father had built together in Sacramento. The family took photos under the orange trees, and the newlyweds drove off in a 1950 Ford convertible. Mary used to say they were going to "set the world on fire in architecture."

[with affection] George bought his uncle's milling business for one dollar and a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey. That became Tacoma Mill Work Supply, and out of it they built Monitor Cabinets. Every cabinet you see in this house? Mary and George designed and built it together.

Now, here's something you should know about Mary: she was a champion sailor. Her father had taught her to sail on the Sacramento River when she was just a girl, and she never stopped. She raced all up and down the West Coast — and in 1960, she won the Adams Cup, the national women's sailing championship, in Chicago.

She never even took her trophies out of their plastic wrapping. That simply wasn't Mary's way.

[warmly] Oh, and I have to tell you about the horse. One anniversary, Mary and George were driving through Hailey, Idaho, and they spotted a life-sized fiberglass horse perched on top of a sign pole at a feed store. Mary couldn't stop looking at it.

Sometime later, George surprised her by craning that very horse into their apple orchard.

So Mary surprised him right back. She went out with a can of spray paint and painted the whole thing purple.

"What shall we call it?" George asked.

"A horse of another color," she said.

[transitioning, reflective] After Mary closed her architecture practice in 1970, she turned to landscape design. She collected Japanese maples — a hundred and eighty of them. She'd drive through neighborhoods looking for neglected ones, pay the homeowners, and crane them onto a flatbed truck. One of them was so old that the Smithsonian came out to catalog it.

[softly] That's how Mary spent her later years. Surrounded by family, by gardens, by the water.
