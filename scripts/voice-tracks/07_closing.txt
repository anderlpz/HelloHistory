Well, I've kept you on the line for a while now. Thank you for listening.

Mary Lund Davis passed away in 2008, but her work lives on — in the buildings she designed, in the families who still live in her Fantastic Homes, and right here, in this house where you're standing.

She asked her family never to sell Del Monte. She considered it her finest building — the truest expression of everything she believed about architecture, about what a home should be.

Things change, of course. Families grow. But here you are, standing in the rooms she designed, looking through the windows she placed for the morning light and the evening light. Something of Mary is still here in these bones, in this light, in the care she put into every detail.

Before you hang up, take a moment. Look around — really look. Notice how the light falls. Notice where your eye travels. Step out onto that deck if you can, and feel how the inside and outside become one thing.

Good design isn't about expense. It's about attention. It's about caring enough to think through every detail. Mary built this house for sixty-three hundred dollars in eight weeks — and more than seventy years later, it still works. That's her legacy.

Thank you for visiting Del Monte. Enjoy your stay. Open the windows. Let the air in. Watch the light change through the day.

And if you pick up this phone again, I'll be happy to tell you more.

Goodbye for now.
