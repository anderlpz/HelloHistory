Del Monte marked only the first chapter in Mary's remarkable career. Now, let me tell you about some of the other wonderful things she went on to accomplish.

In 1961, Mary partnered with a Tacoma developer named Ron Mitchell to create something called the Fantastic Homes. Their mission was simple but radical: prove that affordable housing didn't have to be cheap.

And that is precisely what they did.

They built over two hundred homes in their first seven months. Prices started at just thirty-nine ninety-five — less than four thousand dollars for a well-designed, modern home. The median home price at the time was almost fifteen thousand dollars. Mary and Ron were offering something real to families who never thought they'd own a new house.

Mary designed five models — the Thirty-Niner, Forty-Niner, Fifty-Niner, Seventy-Niner, and a duplex. Same principles as this house: efficient use of space, standardized materials, sliding glass doors to bring the outdoors in, those beautiful fir ceilings. Quality didn't have to cost a fortune.

In 1964, Architectural Record magazine featured one of the Fantastic Homes in their annual "Record Houses" issue — their showcase of the finest architect-designed houses in the country. Mary was honored alongside Richard Meier, I.M. Pei, Craig Ellwood. Some of the biggest names in the profession.

She was the only solo female practitioner they recognized that year.

Mary also designed the family's other homes. After their daughter Kit was born in 1956, they needed more space, so Mary designed a larger house down the road on Alameda Street.

And then in 1969, after she and George sold Monitor Cabinets, Mary designed their final family home on Wollochet Bay near Gig Harbor. She called it Pampas Point, named for the pampas grass that grew over the water like a ship's bowsprit. That house was hexagonal — not a square corner in it. Eight-foot overhangs all around.

Altogether, Mary designed hundreds of buildings over her career. But she always came back to the same question: how do you give people quality design at a price they can afford?

As she put it: "All low-cost housing does not have to be cheap."
