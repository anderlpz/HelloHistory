[Chapter 5: Her Other Work]

Del Monte marked only the first chapter in Mary's career. Now, let me tell you about some of the other wonderful things she went on to accomplish.

In 1961, Mary partnered with a Tacoma developer named Ron Mitchell to create something called the Fantastic Homes. Their mission was simple but radical: to prove that affordable housing didn't have to look cheap.

They built over two hundred homes in their first seven months. Five different models, all with the same principles as this house: efficient use of space, standardized materials, sliding glass doors to bring the outdoors in. Prices started under four thousand dollars — when the average home cost nearly fifteen thousand. Mary and Ron were offering something real to families who never thought they'd own a new house.

In 1964, Architectural Record magazine featured one of the Fantastic Homes in their annual "Record Houses" issue — a showcase of the finest architect-designed houses in the country. Mary was honored alongside Richard Meier, I.M. Pei, and Craig Ellwood. She was the only woman recognized that year.

Mary also designed the family's later homes. After their daughter Kit was born, they needed more space, so Mary designed a larger house down the road. And in 1969, she designed their final family home on Wollochet Bay — a hexagonal house she called Pampas Point, with eight-foot overhangs and not a square corner in it.

Altogether, Mary designed hundreds of buildings.
