[Chapter 2: Mary's Story]

Mary Lund was born on February 13th, 1922, in Sacramento, California. The family legend says she came into this world in a canvas tent on a rice field. That might be true, and it might not — but the family always said it was. <break time="0.5s" /> Either way, thirteen became her lucky number.

Her parents, Anders and Frieda Lund, were Danish immigrants from a tiny hamlet called Bredebro. They'd come to America during the First World War, when things were getting dangerous for young Danes back home. Anders had been a builder and a sailor in the old country.

Mary's father was, by all accounts, a remarkable man. He taught her to sail on the Sacramento River. Taught her to shoot a twenty-two caliber rifle — she could take out a rattlesnake by the time she was ten. <break time="0.5s" /> And most importantly, he taught her to build.



When Mary was just eight years old, the Great Depression hit California. Anders saw the need for small, affordable housing and started building homes. He handed his daughter a hammer and said, <break time="0.5s" /> "Come on, Mary. You're going to help."

He always told her she could do anything a man could do. <break time="0.5s" /> And she believed him.

Mary grew up speaking Danish at home. She didn't know a word of English until kindergarten. She went to McClatchy High School in Sacramento — joined the horseback riding club, the math club, and the art club. Graduated in 1940.

Then she drove herself up to Seattle. <break time="0.5s" /> Alone. <break time="0.5s" /> Enrolled at the University of Washington to study architecture. She later remembered drawing plans with blackout curtains on the windows during the war.

By 1945, she had her degree and her license. <break time="0.5s" /> And she was ready to build.
