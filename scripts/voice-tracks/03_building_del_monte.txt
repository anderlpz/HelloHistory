[Chapter 3: Building Del Monte]

Now, let me tell you how this house actually came to be. <break time="0.5s" /> It's quite a story.

It was 1954. Mary and George Davis had been married for four years. They'd founded their cabinet company, Monitor Cabinets, and Mary had started her own architecture practice. They needed a place to live and work — but they weren't wealthy. Not even close.

What they were, though, was resourceful.

They found this lot on Del Monte Street for six hundred and fifty dollars. And do you know why it was so cheap?? <break time="0.5s" /> The hillside it was on was steep as anything. Where everyone else saw a problem, Mary saw an opportunity.

She designed the house to sit up on that slope, with covered parking tucked underneath. They left all the existing trees in place — no landscaping costs, no lawn to maintain. Just the evergreens that were already here.

Now, here is something remarkable about Mary: she designed the entire structure around the materials they made at their own mill. The posts are spaced exactly four feet three inches apart — the perfect distance to accept a standard four-by-eight sheet of plywood. <break time="0.5s" /> Everything fits. Nothing's wasted.

Now, Mary and George didn't just design this house... but played an active part in building it. They worked right alongside the construction crew as laborers, errand runners, apprentice carpenters, painters. Whatever needed doing.

Eight weeks. <break time="1s" /> That's how long it took from breaking ground to moving in. <break time="0.5s" /> Eight weeks.

And the total cost? Six thousand, three hundred and fifty dollars. That included the lot, the house, and all the furniture. In 1954, that was less than half what most people paid for a new home.

Mary used to say that good design doesn't require a big budget. It just requires good thinking. <break time="1s" /> This house is proof of that.
