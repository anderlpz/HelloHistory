## Script

Now, I've told you about the buildings. Let me tell you a few stories about the life.

*[with warmth]*

George and I met at the University of Washington. We were classmates in the architecture program, and we both won the student AIA gold medal the year we graduated. I made him wait seven years before I'd marry him.

*[laughing slightly]*

We got married in 1950, at my family's home in Sacramento — the house my father and I had built together. We took photos under the orange trees, climbed into our new 1950 Ford convertible, and drove off to set the world on fire in architecture. That's what we used to say: "We're going to set the world on fire."

*[fondly]*

George bought his uncle's milling business for one dollar and a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey. That became Tacoma Mill Work Supply, and out of that we built Monitor Cabinets. Every cabinet in this house, George and I designed and built together.

*[shifting to sailing]*

Now, I have to tell you about the sailing. My father taught me to sail on the Sacramento River when I was just a girl, and I never stopped. I raced all up and down the West Coast. In 1960, I won the Adams Cup — that's the national women's sailing championship — in Chicago.

*[with dry humor]*

I never took my trophies out of their plastic wrapping. What was I going to do, polish them?

*[delighted]*

Oh, and I have to tell you about the horse. One anniversary, George and I were driving through Hailey, Idaho, and we spotted a life-sized fiberglass horse on top of a sign pole at a feed store. I couldn't stop looking at it. Sometime later, George surprised me by craning that very horse into our apple orchard.

*[building to the punchline]*

So I surprised him right back. I went out with a can of spray paint and painted the whole thing purple.

"What shall we call it?" George asked.

"A horse of another color," I said.

*[transitioning, more reflective]*

After I closed my architecture practice in 1970, I turned to landscape design. Designing a garden isn't all that different from designing a house, really. At Pampas Point, I had two acres of overgrown blackberries behind the house. Then an autumn flood washed it all away, and I saw the patterns the water left behind. Nature stuck her foot in, so I said, "Let's just join her."

*[with pride]*

I collected Japanese maples. A hundred and eighty of them. I'd drive through neighborhoods looking for neglected ones, pay the homeowners, and crane them onto a flatbed truck. One of them was so old the Smithsonian came out to catalog it. They thought maybe the seeds came over in a sailor's pocket from Japan.

*[softly]*

That's how I spent my later years. Surrounded by family, by gardens, by the water.

## Notes for Voice Generation

- This chapter is the most personal - warmth throughout
- The horse story should build with comic timing
- "A horse of another color" is the punchline - slight pause before
- Sailing trophies line is dry humor, not false modesty
- Japanese maples section should feel like a passion project
- End softly, setting up the closing chapter
