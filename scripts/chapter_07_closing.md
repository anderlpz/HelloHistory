## Script

*[warmly]*

Well, I've talked your ear off, haven't I? Thank you for listening.

*[with meaning]*

You know, I asked my family never to sell this house. I considered it my finest building — the truest expression of everything I believed about architecture. About what a home should be.

*[slight pause]*

They did sell it, eventually. Things happen. Families change. But here you are, standing in these rooms I designed, looking at these windows I placed for the morning light and the evening light. The bones of this house are still my bones. And something of me is still here.

*[gently instructive]*

Before you hang up, let me leave you with this: Look around. Really look. Notice how the light falls. Notice where your eye travels. Step out onto that deck and feel how the inside and outside become one thing.

*[with conviction]*

Good design isn't about expense. It's about attention. It's about caring enough to think through every detail. Six thousand dollars, eight weeks, and sixty years later, it still works. That's what I'm proudest of.

*[final warmth]*

Enjoy your stay in my house. Open the windows. Let the air in. Watch the light change through the day.

And if you pick up this phone again, I'll be here. I've always been here.

*[softly]*

Thank you for visiting Del Monte.

Goodbye for now.

## Notes for Voice Generation

- This is the emotional conclusion - measured pace throughout
- "They did sell it" should be accepting, not bitter
- "Something of me is still here" - meaningful but not spooky
- The practical advice (look around, notice the light) keeps it grounded
- Final "Goodbye for now" should feel like a genuine farewell from a friend
- Overall tone: a gracious host saying goodbye
