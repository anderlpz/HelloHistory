[Chapter 1: Welcome to Del Monte]

You're staying in a piece of mid-century architectural history.

In 1954, a young architect named Mary Lund Davis built this house with her husband George. It was her first home, her office, and what she always called <break time="0.5s" /> her finest building.

Now, Mary wasn't just any architect. She was the first woman to become a licensed architect in Washington State after World War Two. <break time="0.5s" /> And this modest house on a hillside in Fircrest? She and George built the whole thing themselves.

Take a look around you. <break time="1s" /> Notice how open it feels, even though it's only about a thousand square feet? That was intentional. Mary used cabinets instead of walls to divide the spaces — a signature of her work. Why waste space on a blank wall when you can have storage and openness at the same time?

And those windows up high, just below the roofline — those are called clerestory windows. They run all the way around the house. Mary planned every single one for a specific time of day. <break time="0.5s" /> Morning light comes from the east, into the kitchen. Evening light comes from the west, into the bedroom. <break time="1s" />

Mary always sought to think about every square inch of her properties deeply and intentionally. That's what makes them so special.

<break time="1s" />

Over the next few minutes, I would like to tell you more — about Mary's remarkable life, how she came to build this place, and why it mattered so much to her.

Stay on the line, and let's explore Del Monte together.

[Chapter 2: Mary's Story]

Mary Lund was born on February 13th, 1922, in Sacramento, California. The family legend says she came into this world in a canvas tent on a rice field. That might be true, and it might not — but the family always said it was. <break time="0.5s" /> Either way, thirteen became her lucky number.

Her parents, Anders and Frieda Lund, were Danish immigrants from a tiny hamlet called Bredebro. They'd come to America during the First World War, when things were getting dangerous for young Danes back home. Anders had been a builder and a sailor in the old country.

Mary's father was, by all accounts, a remarkable man. He taught her to sail on the Sacramento River. Taught her to shoot a twenty-two caliber rifle — she could take out a rattlesnake by the time she was ten. <break time="0.5s" /> And most importantly, he taught her to build.



When Mary was just eight years old, the Great Depression hit California. Anders saw the need for small, affordable housing and started building homes. He handed his daughter a hammer and said, <break time="0.5s" /> "Come on, Mary. You're going to help."

<break time="1s" />

He always told her she could do anything a man could do. <break time="0.5s" /> And she believed him.

<break time="1s" />

Mary grew up speaking Danish at home. She didn't know a word of English until kindergarten. She went to McClatchy High School in Sacramento — joined the horseback riding club, the math club, and the art club. Graduated in 1940.

Then she drove herself up to Seattle. <break time="0.5s" /> Alone. <break time="0.5s" /> Enrolled at the University of Washington to study architecture. She later remembered drawing plans with blackout curtains on the windows during the war.

By 1945, she had her degree and her license. <break time="0.5s" /> And she was ready to build.

<break time="2s" />

[Chapter 3: Building Del Monte]

Now, let me tell you how this house actually came to be. <break time="0.5s" /> It's quite a story.

It was 1954. Mary and George Davis had been married for four years. They'd founded their cabinet company, Monitor Cabinets, and Mary had started her own architecture practice. They needed a place to live and work — but they weren't wealthy. Not even close.

<break time="0.5s" />

What they were, though, was resourceful.

<break time="1s" />



They found this lot on Del Monte Street for six hundred and fifty dollars. And do you know why it was so cheap?? <break time="0.5s" /> The hillside it was on was steep as anything. Where everyone else saw a problem, Mary saw an opportunity.

<break time="1s" /> 

She designed the house to sit up on that slope, with covered parking tucked underneath. They left all the existing trees in place — no landscaping costs, no lawn to maintain. Just the evergreens that were already here.

<break time="1s" />

Now, here is something remarkable about Mary: she designed the entire structure around the materials they made at their own mill. The posts are spaced exactly four feet three inches apart — the perfect distance to accept a standard four-by-eight sheet of plywood. <break time="0.5s" /> Everything fits. Nothing's wasted.

Now, Mary and George didn't just design this house... but played an active part in building it. They worked right alongside the construction crew as laborers, errand runners, apprentice carpenters, painters. Whatever needed doing.

<break time="1.5s" />

Eight weeks. <break time="1s" /> That's how long it took from breaking ground to moving in. <break time="0.5s" /> Eight weeks.

<break time="1s" />

And the total cost? Six thousand, three hundred and fifty dollars. That included the lot, the house, and all the furniture. In 1954, that was less than half what most people paid for a new home.

<break time="1s" />

Mary used to say that good design doesn't require a big budget. It just requires good thinking. <break time="1s" /> This house is proof of that.

<break time="2s" />

[Chapter 4: The Design Philosophy]

What makes this house so special? <break time="0.5s" /> Let me try to explain how Mary thought about architecture.

Look up at the ceiling. <break time="1s" /> See those long beams running overhead — and how they extend past the walls, right out into the trees? That's not an accident. Mary wanted this house to feel like it grew from the hillside. Like a tree house. Like you're suspended among the evergreens, not just sitting on the ground.

<break time="1s" />

She loved to quote Frank Lloyd Wright: <break time="0.5s" /> "The human spirit is best when not boxed in." <break time="0.5s" /> And you can feel that philosophy everywhere in this house.

This style came out of the modern movement — a light wooden frame, a thin elegant exterior. But here in the Pacific Northwest, architects like Mary made it their own. They used local timber — Douglas fir, cedar, plywood. Honest materials that don't pretend to be something they're not.

Look at the walls around you. <break time="0.5s" /> You can see exactly what they're made of — plywood panels held in place by simple sills. The same sills hold the glass. Nothing's hidden. The structure is visible, and it's beautiful.

<break time="1s" />

And the way Mary brought the outdoors in — that was everything to her. Those clerestory windows pull light from every direction. The deck extends your living space into the forest. When you open that sliding door on a summer morning, she wanted you to wonder: where does the house end and the world begin?

<break time="1s" />

Mary's philosophy came down to this: use what you have, waste nothing, hide nothing, and always <break time="0.3s" /> — always — <break time="0.2s" /> let the light in.

<break time="2s" />

[Chapter 5: Her Other Work]

Del Monte marked only the first chapter in Mary's career. Now, let me tell you about some of the other wonderful things she went on to accomplish.

In 1961, Mary partnered with a Tacoma developer named Ron Mitchell to create something called the Fantastic Homes. Their mission was simple but radical: to prove that affordable housing didn't have to look cheap.

<break time="1s" />

They built over two hundred homes in their first seven months. Five different models, all with the same principles as this house: efficient use of space, standardized materials, sliding glass doors to bring the outdoors in. Prices started under four thousand dollars — when the average home cost nearly fifteen thousand. Mary and Ron were offering something real to families who never thought they'd own a new house.

In 1964, Architectural Record magazine featured one of the Fantastic Homes in their annual "Record Houses" issue — a showcase of the finest architect-designed houses in the country. Mary was honored alongside Richard Meier, I.M. Pei, and Craig Ellwood. She was the only woman recognized that year.

<break time="1.5s" />

Mary also designed the family's later homes. After their daughter Kit was born, they needed more space, so Mary designed a larger house down the road. And in 1969, she designed their final family home on Wollochet Bay — a hexagonal house she called Pampas Point, with eight-foot overhangs and not a square corner in it.

Altogether, Mary designed hundreds of buildings.

[Chapter 6: Closing]

Well, I've kept you on the line for a while now. <break time="0.5s" /> Thank you for listening.

<break time="1s" />

Before you hang up, take a moment. Look around — really look. <break time="1s" /> Notice how the light falls. Notice where your eye travels.

Step out onto that deck, and feel how the inside and outside become one thing.

<break time="1s" />

This house has stood for more than seventy years. Morning light has poured through those east windows, evening light has settled into the

bedroom — just as Mary planned. Look up at those beams stretching out toward the trees. They've held this roof through every season since

1954. <break time="0.5s" /> The place still works. It still feels right. And that's what good design does. It persists.

<break time="1.5s" />

Thank you for visiting Del Monte. Open the windows. Let the air in. Watch the light change through the day.

<break time="1s" />

And if you pick up this phone again, I'll be happy to tell you the story from the beginning. <break time="0.5s" /> Goodbye for now.
