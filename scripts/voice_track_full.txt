[Chapter 1: Welcome to Del Monte]

Welcome to Del Monte. You've just picked up a piece of history.

In 1954, a young architect named Mary Lund Davis built this house with her husband George. It was her first home, her office, and what she always called her finest building.

Now, Mary wasn't just any architect. She was the first woman to become a licensed architect in Washington State after World War Two. And this modest house on a hillside in Fircrest? She and George built the whole thing — lot, house, and all the furniture — for just sixty-three hundred dollars.

Take a look around you. Notice how open it feels, even though it's only about a thousand square feet? That was intentional. Mary used cabinets instead of walls to divide the spaces — a signature of her work. Why waste space on a blank wall, she figured, when you can have storage and openness at the same time?

And those windows up high, just below the roofline — those are called clerestory windows. They run all the way around the house. Mary planned every single one for a specific time of day. Morning light comes from the east, into the kitchen. Evening light comes from the west, into the bedroom.

Mary truly thought of everything.

Over the next few minutes, I would like to tell you more — about Mary's remarkable life, how she and George built this place in just eight weeks, and why she considered it her finest work.

Stay on the line, and let's explore Del Monte together.


[Chapter 2: Mary's Story]

Mary Lund was born on February 13th, 1922, in Sacramento, California. The family legend says she came into this world in a canvas tent on a rice field. That might be true, and it might not — but the family always said it was. Either way, thirteen became her lucky number.

Her parents, Anders and Frieda Lund, were Danish immigrants from a tiny hamlet called Bredebro. They'd come to America during the First World War, when things were getting dangerous for young Danes back home. Anders had been a builder and a sailor in the old country.

Mary's father was, by all accounts, a remarkable man. He taught her to sail on the Sacramento River. Taught her to shoot a twenty-two caliber rifle — she could take out a rattlesnake by the time she was ten. And most importantly, he taught her to build.

When Mary was just eight years old, the Great Depression hit California. Anders saw the need for small, affordable housing and started building homes. He handed his daughter a hammer and said, "Come on, Mary. You're going to help."

He always told her she could do anything a man could do. And she believed him. Those words became her touchstone — they carried her through everything that came after.

Mary grew up speaking Danish at home. She didn't know a word of English until kindergarten. She went to McClatchy High School in Sacramento — joined the horseback riding club, the math club, and the art club. Graduated in 1940.

Then she drove herself up to Seattle. Alone. Enrolled at the University of Washington to study architecture. It was 1941 — and she later remembered drawing plans with blackout curtains on the windows during the war.

By the time she graduated in 1945, Mary Lund had become the first woman to earn an architecture license in Washington State after World War Two.

But her remarkable story was only beginning to unfold.


[Chapter 3: Building Del Monte]

Now, let me tell you how this house actually came to be. It's quite a story.

It was 1954. Mary and George Davis had been married for four years. They'd founded their cabinet company, Monitor Cabinets, back in 1948, and Mary had started her own architecture practice in 1952. They needed a place to live and work — but they weren't wealthy. Not even close.

What they were, though, was resourceful.

They found this lot on Del Monte Street for six hundred and fifty dollars. You know why it was so cheap? That hillside. Steep as anything. Everyone else saw a problem. Mary saw an opportunity.

She designed the house to sit up on that slope, with covered parking tucked underneath. They left all the existing trees in place — no landscaping costs, no lawn to maintain. Just the evergreens that were already here.

Now, here is something remarkable about Mary: she designed the entire structure around the materials they made at their own mill. The posts are spaced exactly four feet three inches apart — the perfect distance to accept a standard four-by-eight sheet of plywood. Everything fits. Nothing's wasted.

Mary and George didn't just design this house — they built it. They worked right alongside the construction crew as laborers, errand runners, apprentice carpenters, painters. Whatever needed doing.

Eight weeks. That's how long it took from breaking ground to moving in. Eight weeks.

And the total cost? Six thousand, three hundred and fifty dollars. That included the lot, the house, and all the furniture. In 1954, that was less than half what most people paid for a new home.

The cabinets, of course, were free — they made them at Monitor. The kitchen counter extends out and drops down to become the dining table. Every single inch serves a purpose.

Mary used to say that good design doesn't require a big budget. It just requires good thinking. This house is proof of that.


[Chapter 4: The Design Philosophy]

What makes this house so special? Let me try to explain how Mary thought about architecture.

Look up at the ceiling. See those long beams running overhead — and how they extend past the walls, right out into the trees? That's not an accident. Mary wanted this house to feel like it grew from the hillside. Like a tree house. Like you're suspended among the evergreens, not just sitting on the ground.

She loved to quote Frank Lloyd Wright: "The human spirit is best when not boxed in." And you can feel that philosophy everywhere in this house.

This style — what architects call "skin and bones" — came out of the International modern movement. A light wooden frame, a thin elegant skin. But here in the Pacific Northwest, architects like Mary adapted it. They used local timber — Douglas fir, cedar, plywood. Honest materials that don't pretend to be something they're not.

Look at the walls around you. You can see exactly what they're made of — plywood panels held in place by simple sills. The same sills hold the glass. It's all one system, one plane. Nothing's hidden. The bones are visible, and they're beautiful.

And the way Mary brought the outdoors in — that was everything to her. Those clerestory windows pull light from every direction. The deck extends your living space into the forest. When you open that sliding door on a summer morning, where does the house end and the world begin?

That's the question she wanted you to ask.

Now, some architects get so caught up in aesthetics that they forget people have to actually live in these spaces. But Mary never forgot. Every cabinet is placed to define a room and give you storage. The plumbing is all on one wall to save money. Form follows function — but in her hands, function was beautiful.

Mary's philosophy came down to this: use what you have, waste nothing, hide nothing, and always — always — let the light in.


[Chapter 5: Her Other Work]

Del Monte marked only the first chapter in Mary's remarkable career. Now, let me tell you about some of the other wonderful things she went on to accomplish.

In 1961, Mary partnered with a Tacoma developer named Ron Mitchell to create something called the Fantastic Homes. Their mission was simple but radical: prove that affordable housing didn't have to be cheap.

And that is precisely what they did.

They built over two hundred homes in their first seven months. Prices started at just thirty-nine ninety-five — less than four thousand dollars for a well-designed, modern home. The median home price at the time was almost fifteen thousand dollars. Mary and Ron were offering something real to families who never thought they'd own a new house.

Mary designed five models — the Thirty-Niner, Forty-Niner, Fifty-Niner, Seventy-Niner, and a duplex. Same principles as this house: efficient use of space, standardized materials, sliding glass doors to bring the outdoors in, those beautiful fir ceilings. Quality didn't have to cost a fortune.

In 1964, Architectural Record magazine featured one of the Fantastic Homes in their annual "Record Houses" issue — their showcase of the finest architect-designed houses in the country. Mary was honored alongside Richard Meier, I.M. Pei, Craig Ellwood. Some of the biggest names in the profession.

She was the only solo female practitioner they recognized that year.

Mary also designed the family's other homes. After their daughter Kit was born in 1956, they needed more space, so Mary designed a larger house down the road on Alameda Street.

And then in 1969, after she and George sold Monitor Cabinets, Mary designed their final family home on Wollochet Bay near Gig Harbor. She called it Pampas Point, named for the pampas grass that grew over the water like a ship's bowsprit. That house was hexagonal — not a square corner in it. Eight-foot overhangs all around.

Altogether, Mary designed hundreds of buildings over her career. But she always came back to the same question: how do you give people quality design at a price they can afford?

As she put it: "All low-cost housing does not have to be cheap."


[Chapter 6: Personal Stories]

Now, I've told you about the buildings. Let me share a few stories about the life Mary lived.

Mary met George Davis at the University of Washington. They were classmates in the architecture program, and they both won the student AIA gold medal the year they graduated. She made him wait seven years before she'd marry him.

They got married in 1950, at the home Mary and her father had built together in Sacramento. The family took photos under the orange trees, and the newlyweds drove off in a 1950 Ford convertible. Mary used to say they were going to "set the world on fire in architecture."

George bought his uncle's milling business for one dollar and a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey. That became Tacoma Mill Work Supply, and out of it they built Monitor Cabinets. Every cabinet you see in this house? Mary and George designed and built it together.

Now, here's something you should know about Mary: she was a champion sailor. Her father had taught her to sail on the Sacramento River when she was just a girl, and she never stopped. She raced all up and down the West Coast — and in 1960, she won the Adams Cup, the national women's sailing championship, in Chicago.

She never even took her trophies out of their plastic wrapping. That simply wasn't Mary's way.

Oh, and I have to tell you about the horse. One anniversary, Mary and George were driving through Hailey, Idaho, and they spotted a life-sized fiberglass horse perched on top of a sign pole at a feed store. Mary couldn't stop looking at it.

Sometime later, George surprised her by craning that very horse into their apple orchard.

So Mary surprised him right back. She went out with a can of spray paint and painted the whole thing purple.

"What shall we call it?" George asked.

"A horse of another color," she said.

After Mary closed her architecture practice in 1970, she turned to landscape design. She collected Japanese maples — a hundred and eighty of them. She'd drive through neighborhoods looking for neglected ones, pay the homeowners, and crane them onto a flatbed truck. One of them was so old that the Smithsonian came out to catalog it.

That's how Mary spent her later years. Surrounded by family, by gardens, by the water.


[Chapter 7: Closing]

Well, I've kept you on the line for a while now. Thank you for listening.

Mary Lund Davis passed away in 2008, but her work lives on — in the buildings she designed, in the families who still live in her Fantastic Homes, and right here, in this house where you're standing.

She asked her family never to sell Del Monte. She considered it her finest building — the truest expression of everything she believed about architecture, about what a home should be.

Things change, of course. Families grow. But here you are, standing in the rooms she designed, looking through the windows she placed for the morning light and the evening light. Something of Mary is still here in these bones, in this light, in the care she put into every detail.

Before you hang up, take a moment. Look around — really look. Notice how the light falls. Notice where your eye travels. Step out onto that deck if you can, and feel how the inside and outside become one thing.

Good design isn't about expense. It's about attention. It's about caring enough to think through every detail. Mary built this house for sixty-three hundred dollars in eight weeks — and more than seventy years later, it still works. That's her legacy.

Thank you for visiting Del Monte. Enjoy your stay. Open the windows. Let the air in. Watch the light change through the day.

And if you pick up this phone again, I'll be happy to tell you more.

Goodbye for now.
