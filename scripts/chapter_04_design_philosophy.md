## Script

What makes this house so special? [thoughtfully] Let me try to explain how Mary thought about architecture.

Look up at the ceiling. See those long beams running overhead — and how they extend past the walls, right out into the trees? That's not an accident. Mary wanted this house to feel like it grew from the hillside. Like a tree house. Like you're suspended among the evergreens, not just sitting on the ground.

[with appreciation]

She loved to quote Frank Lloyd Wright: "The human spirit is best when not boxed in." And you can feel that philosophy everywhere in this house.

This style — what architects call "skin and bones" — came out of the International modern movement. A light wooden frame, a thin elegant skin. But here in the Pacific Northwest, architects like Mary adapted it. They used local timber — Douglas fir, cedar, plywood. Honest materials that don't pretend to be something they're not.

[gesturing through words]

Look at the walls around you. You can see exactly what they're made of — plywood panels held in place by simple sills. The same sills hold the glass. It's all one system, one plane. Nothing's hidden. The bones are visible, and they're beautiful.

[passionate]

And the way Mary brought the outdoors in — that was everything to her. Those clerestory windows pull light from every direction. The deck extends your living space into the forest. When you open that sliding door on a summer morning, where does the house end and the world begin?

That's the question she wanted you to ask.

[grounded]

Now, some architects get so caught up in aesthetics that they forget people have to actually live in these spaces. Not Mary. Every cabinet is placed to define a room and give you storage. The plumbing is all on one wall to save money. Form follows function — but in her hands, function was beautiful.

[summing up]

Mary's philosophy came down to this: use what you have, waste nothing, hide nothing, and always — always — let the light in.
