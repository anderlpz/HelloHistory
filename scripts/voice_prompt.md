# ElevenLabs Voice Design: Del Monte Narrator

## Voice Prompt

```
A 1960s documentary narrator. A woman in her 40s with a warm, refined voice - like a narrator from a mid-century educational film or the Wonderful World of Disney. She has that classic optimistic, earnest quality of postwar America. Articulate with clear enunciation, unhurried pacing, and genuine warmth. Neutral American accent with a slightly transatlantic quality. The audio has a warm, vintage feel - like a well-preserved film from 1962. She sounds like she's sharing something truly wonderful with you.

## Text to Preview

```
Welcome to Del Monte. [warmly] In 1954, a young architect named Mary Lund Davis built this house with her husband George. It was her first home, her office, and what she always called her finest building. [slight pause] Mary was a pioneer - the first woman to become a licensed architect in Washington State after World War Two. And this modest house on a hillside? She built the whole thing - lot, house, and furniture - for just sixty-three hundred dollars. [light chuckle] Let me tell you how she did it.
