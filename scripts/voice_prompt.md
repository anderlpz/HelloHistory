# ElevenLabs Voice Design: Del Monte Narrator

## Voice Prompt

```
A woman in her 40s with a warm, inviting voice. She speaks like a documentary narrator who genuinely loves her subject - knowledgeable but never dry, educational but filled with wonder. Her tone is rich and clear with a neutral American accent. She has the quality of a trusted friend sharing something special with you, like a museum guide who can't help but smile when telling her favorite stories. Unhurried, conversational pacing with natural warmth. Perfect audio quality.

```
Welcome to Del Monte. [warmly] In 1954, a young architect named Mary Lund Davis built this house with her husband George. It was her first home, her office, and what she always called her finest building. [slight pause] Mary was a pioneer - the first woman to become a licensed architect in Washington State after World War Two. And this modest house on a hillside? She built the whole thing - lot, house, and furniture - for just sixty-three hundred dollars. [light chuckle] Let me tell you how she did it.
