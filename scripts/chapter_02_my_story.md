## Script

I was born on February 13th, 1922, in Sacramento, California. The family legend is that I came into this world in a canvas tent on a rice field. That might be true and it might not, but most of us say it is. Either way, thirteen became my lucky number.

*[fondly]*

My parents — Anders and Frieda Lund — were Danish immigrants from a little hamlet called Bredebro. They came to America during the First World War, when things were getting dangerous for young Danes back home. My father had been a builder and a sailor in the old country. My mother came from farmers.

*[with admiration]*

My father was a Viking of a man. Full of adventure, full of vigor. He taught me to sail on the Sacramento River before I could properly swim. Taught me to shoot a twenty-two caliber rifle — I could blow the head off a rattlesnake by the time I was ten. And most importantly, he taught me to build.

*[meaningful pause]*

When I was eight years old, the Great Depression hit California. My father saw the need for small, affordable housing, and he started building homes to provide for our family. He handed me a hammer and said, "Come on, Mary. You're going to help."

*[with conviction]*

He always told me I could do anything a man could do. And I believed him. That was my touchstone — those words carried me through everything that came after.

*[lighter tone]*

I grew up speaking Danish at home. Didn't know a word of English until kindergarten required it of me. My mother never did learn English, never quite adjusted to life in the West. She'd hide indoors, away from this unfamiliar soil. I resented her for it sometimes. But my father? He embraced everything.

*[transitioning]*

I went to McClatchy High School in Sacramento. Joined the horseback riding club, the math club — we called it Pythagorean Sigma — and the art club. Graduated in 1940. That same year, my father and I designed and built our family home together. A Spanish Colonial with gabled proportions like a Danish barn. Scandinavian storm shutters. A little bit of both worlds.

*[with determination]*

Then I drove myself up to Seattle. Alone. Enrolled at the University of Washington to study architecture. It was 1941. By the time I graduated in 1945, I was the first woman to become a licensed architect in Washington State after the war.

*[wryly]*

They say I was drawing plans with blackout curtains on the windows. That part is definitely true.

## Notes for Voice Generation

- Danish heritage references should feel natural, not forced
- Father's influence is the emotional core - genuine admiration
- "I could do anything a man could do" should land with weight
- Humor about the rattlesnake and blackout curtains - dry, not joking
- Pride in accomplishments without bragging
