## Script

Now let me tell you how George and I actually built this house.

*[matter-of-fact]*

It was 1954. We'd been married four years, and we needed a place to live and work. We weren't wealthy — not even close — but we were resourceful. George and I had founded our cabinet company, Monitor Cabinets, back in 1948. We knew materials. We knew what things cost. And we knew how to work.

*[with humor]*

We found this lot on Del Monte Street for six hundred and fifty dollars. You know why it was so cheap? That hillside. Steep as anything. Everyone else saw a problem. I saw an opportunity.

*[warming to the story]*

I designed the house to sit up on that slope, with covered parking underneath. We left all the existing trees in place — no landscaping costs, no lawn to maintain. Just the evergreens that were already here, doing exactly what nature intended.

*[proudly]*

The whole structural system, I designed around the sheet goods we made at our mill. The posts are spaced exactly four feet three inches apart — perfect for accepting a standard four-by-eight sheet of plywood or Masonite. Everything fits. Nothing's wasted.

*[leaning in]*

George and I worked right alongside the construction crew. We were errand boys, laborers, apprentice carpenters, painters — whatever needed doing. We'd work all day and fall into bed exhausted.

*[pause for effect]*

Eight weeks. That's how long it took to build this house. Eight weeks from breaking ground to moving in.

*[with satisfaction]*

And the total cost? Six thousand three hundred and fifty dollars. That's the lot, the house, and all the furniture. In 1954, that was less than half what most people paid for a new home.

*[reflective]*

The cabinets, of course, were free — we made them ourselves at Monitor. The kitchen counter? It extends out and drops down to become the dining table. That Masonite board floating the couch in the living room? Same principle. Every inch serves a purpose.

*[confidently]*

This house proved what I always believed: good design doesn't require a big budget. It requires good thinking.

## Notes for Voice Generation

- This is a "how we did it" story - practical and grounded
- The $650 lot and $6,350 total should land as impressive
- "Eight weeks" deserves a pause before and emphasis
- Pride in resourcefulness, not in spending
- "Good thinking" at the end should feel like a thesis statement
