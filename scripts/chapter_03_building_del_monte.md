## Script

Now, let me tell you how this house actually came to be. [warmly] It's quite a story.

It was 1954. Mary and George Davis had been married for four years. They'd founded their cabinet company, Monitor Cabinets, back in 1948, and Mary had started her own architecture practice in 1952. They needed a place to live and work — but they weren't wealthy. Not even close.

[with appreciation]

What they were, though, was resourceful.

They found this lot on Del Monte Street for six hundred and fifty dollars. [slight pause] You know why it was so cheap? That hillside. Steep as anything. Everyone else saw a problem. Mary saw an opportunity.

She designed the house to sit up on that slope, with covered parking tucked underneath. They left all the existing trees in place — no landscaping costs, no lawn to maintain. Just the evergreens that were already here.

[leaning into the story]

And here's the thing about Mary: she designed the entire structure around the materials they made at their own mill. The posts are spaced exactly four feet three inches apart — the perfect distance to accept a standard four-by-eight sheet of plywood. Everything fits. Nothing's wasted.

Mary and George didn't just design this house — they built it. They worked right alongside the construction crew as laborers, errand runners, apprentice carpenters, painters. Whatever needed doing.

[pause for effect]

Eight weeks. That's how long it took from breaking ground to moving in. Eight weeks.

[with satisfaction]

And the total cost? Six thousand, three hundred and fifty dollars. That included the lot, the house, and all the furniture. In 1954, that was less than half what most people paid for a new home.

The cabinets, of course, were free — they made them at Monitor. The kitchen counter extends out and drops down to become the dining table. Every single inch serves a purpose.

[admiringly]

Mary used to say that good design doesn't require a big budget. It just requires good thinking. This house is proof of that.

## Notes for Voice Generation

- This is a "how they did it" story - appreciation for their resourcefulness
- $650 lot and $6,350 total should land as impressive
- "Eight weeks" deserves a pause and emphasis
- "Good thinking" at the end - let it resonate
